# grass-fire-metrics
This repository hosts data published in Jonko, Yedinak, Conley, and Linn (2020): "Sensitivity of grass fires burning in marginal conditions to small perturbations in the turbulent wind field"

The following files were generated by computing fire behavior metrics from simulations performed with LANL's coupled atmosphere-fire behavior model FIRETEC 1.3.

1. area_burned.csv contains the area burned per second in m^2 for 600 seconds of simulation for 45 CORE simulations, 20 INIT simulations and 20 BOUND simulations
2. fire_perimeter.csv contains the fire perimeters in m for 600 seconds of simulation for 45 CORE simulations, 20 INIT simulations and 20 BOUND simulations
3. consumption_per_second.csv contains consumption in kg/s for 600 seconds of simulation for 45 CORE simulations, 20 INIT simulations and 20 BOUND simulations
4. rate_of_spread.csv contains values of distance of the fire front from the ignition line in m for 600 seconds of simulation for 45 CORE simulations, 20 INIT simulations and 20 BOUND simulations
